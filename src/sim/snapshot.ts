/**
 * Snapshot, restore and hash of the whole simulation.
 *
 * These three operations are the shared foundation under every networked
 * requirement, and they only work because `World` is plain data:
 *
 *   - **Rollback netcode** rewinds to a past tick and re-simulates with
 *     corrected input. That is `restore()` followed by N × `simStep()`.
 *   - **Replays** seek to a mid-match tick without replaying from zero, by
 *     restoring the nearest keyframe.
 *   - **Match validation / MMR** lets a server re-run a submitted match and
 *     confirm the result, which is `hash()` agreeing at the final tick.
 *   - **Desync detection** compares `hash()` between peers each tick and
 *     reports the exact tick a divergence appeared.
 *
 * The invariant that makes all of it possible: **no sim state may live
 * anywhere unreachable.** No closures, no functions, no `Map`/`Set` held on
 * `World`, no references between entities other than ids. If you add a field
 * to `World` that a structured clone cannot carry, you have broken rollback,
 * replays and validation simultaneously — and the determinism test will not
 * necessarily catch it, because a fresh sim from tick 0 still works.
 *
 * See docs/DECISIONS.md D-010.

 * state, but it allocates. If rollback ever needs to snapshot every tick at
 * 100+ units, this is the thing to replace — with a structure-of-arrays layout
 * backed by typed arrays, where a snapshot becomes a `TypedArray.set()` memcpy
 * into a ring buffer instead of a graph walk. The call sites do not change;
 * only this file does. That is the point of routing everything through here.

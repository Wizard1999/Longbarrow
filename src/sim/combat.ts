 * Combat: derived stats, cohesion, positional resolution and elimination.

 * than what the player does mid-fight. So every modifier here is positional —
 * high ground, facing, crowding — and none of them reward clicking.
 *
 * Damage is applied as a deterministic expectation rather than a die roll.
 * §2 asks for battles that are "quick and decisive" with micro *not* a major
 * skill factor; rolling to hit adds variance that rewards neither positioning
 * nor skill, only luck, and it would make identical engagements resolve
 * differently. Accuracy is therefore a multiplier, not a coin flip. It also
 * keeps combat off the RNG entirely, which keeps replays and lockstep simpler.

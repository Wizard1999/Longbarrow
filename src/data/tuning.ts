 * These numbers are solved backwards from that requirement:
 *

 * Measured by local crowding rather than by squad membership. Basing it on
 * squads would make it trivially dodgeable: an ungrouped deathball would take
 * no penalty at all, which is the exact formation the rule exists to discourage.
 * See docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md — the design text is ambiguous between the two.

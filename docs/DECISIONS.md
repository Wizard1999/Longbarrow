# Design Decisions

Append-only. Each entry records what was decided, why, and what was rejected.
**Do not relitigate these without a new entry superseding the old one.**

---

## D-001 — The simulation is pure and headless
**Date:** 2026-07-26

**Decision:** `src/sim/` never imports from `render/`, `input/` or `ui/`.
Enforced by `tests/architecture.test.ts`.

**Reason:** Replays, lockstep multiplayer and a testable AI opponent are all
free if determinism holds from day one, and all three are near-impossible to
retrofit. The cost of the rule is close to zero.

**Rejected:** Letting views read/write sim state directly for convenience.

---

## D-002 — All durations are ticks, never seconds
**Date:** 2026-07-26

**Decision:** Every duration in the simulation is expressed in ticks.

**Reason:** Wall-clock time is non-deterministic and frame-rate dependent.

**Consequence:** Changing `TICK_HZ` rescales the meaning of every constant —
see D-004.

---

## D-003 — Units do not execute player commands directly
**Date:** 2026-07-26

**Decision:** Player intent flows through squads and behaviour chains rather
than into individual units.

```
Player command → Squad → Behaviour chain → Individual units
```

**Reason:** The game is about expressing intent, not mechanical execution.

**Rejected:** Direct per-unit commands as the primary interaction, StarCraft
style. Note this remains *possible* — it is simply the worse way to play, not
a removed capability.

---

## D-004 — Tick rate is 30 Hz, not 20 and not 128
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** `TICK_HZ` raised from 20 to **30**. All tick-denominated
constants multiplied by 1.5 to preserve wall-clock behaviour.

**Reason.** The 128-tick figure comes from competitive Counter-Strike, and it
solves a problem this game does not have. In a hitscan FPS, tick rate governs
*hit registration* — whether a shot fired at a target moving across your screen
at high angular velocity connects. That is a genuine 8 ms-scale problem.

An RTS has a different bottleneck. Perceived responsiveness here is dominated
by **input-to-feedback latency**, not simulation granularity, and tick rate is
only one small term in that sum:

| Tick rate | Worst-case command delay | Average |
|---|---|---|
| 20 Hz | 50 ms | 25 ms |
| **30 Hz** | **33 ms** | **17 ms** |
| 60 Hz | 17 ms | 8 ms |
| 128 Hz | 8 ms | 4 ms |

Going 20 → 30 buys 8 ms of average latency for a 1.5× sim cost. Going 30 → 128
would buy a further 13 ms for a **4.3× sim cost** — and sim cost is exactly the
budget we committed to spending on 100+ units at 1080p/30fps on a 2017
integrated GPU. Target acquisition is the expensive part and scales with unit
count; multiplying it by 4.3 to save 13 ms is a bad trade.

For reference, shipped RTS tick rates: StarCraft II ≈ 22.4, Age of Empires II
≈ 20–30, Company of Heroes ≈ 10, Supreme Commander 10. None of these feel
unresponsive, because they spend their responsiveness budget elsewhere.

30 Hz also divides evenly into 60 Hz displays (exactly 2 render frames per
tick), which keeps interpolation judder-free. 128 divides into nothing.

**Where responsiveness actually comes from** — these matter far more than tick
rate and are the real work:
1. **Render interpolation** (already built) — views lerp with the loop's `alpha`,
   so motion is smooth at any framerate regardless of tick rate.
2. **Immediate input acknowledgement** — click feedback (marker, cursor, sound)
   must fire on the frame of the click, before the tick applies the command.
   *Not yet built — see TODO.*
3. **Command batching at tick boundaries** rather than dropping input between ticks.

**Rejected:** 128 Hz (cost without benefit), 60 Hz (2× cost for 8 ms; revisit
only if profiling shows headroom at 100+ units), staying at 20 Hz.

**Locked because:** tick rate is baked into the replay format. Changing it later
invalidates every recorded replay. Decided now, deliberately, before the replay
system is built.

---

## D-005 — Art direction: Ghibli-influenced, hue-path shading
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** Surfaces are shaded along a **hue path** — three distinct colours
(shade / mid / lit) — rather than one colour lit and darkened. Shadows shift
hue instead of going black.

**Reason:** This is the single largest difference between "stylised" and "3D
render with the lights turned down". It is fragment maths, so it costs
essentially nothing and can ship in every quality tier.

**Consequence:** The *look* is not tiered; the *cost* is. Quality tiers scale
shadow resolution, antialiasing, pixel ratio and mesh subdivision only.

---

## D-006 — Performance target
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** 1080p, 30 fps, **100+ units**, on a ~2017 integrated GPU
(Intel HD 620 class), from a cold page load in a browser.

**Reason:** The game must run on practically any machine straight from the
website. Late-game unit counts are where performance actually collapses, so the
target is set at late-game load rather than a comfortable early-game figure.

---

## D-007 — Missions become first-class simulation objects
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** When the mission system is built, `Mission` lives in `src/sim/`
and is serialized in replays. It is **not** a UI construct.

**Reason:** Missions carry objective, priority, fallback position and
completion/failure conditions — all of which affect unit behaviour and
therefore must be deterministic and replayable. Building it in the UI layer
first would make it unreplayable and force a rewrite.

**Consequence:** `Mission` sits *above* `Squad` in the hierarchy. Squads
currently own behaviour chains directly; that ownership moves up when missions
land. See `UI_BLUEPRINT.md`.

---

## D-008 — Replays record commands, not state
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** A replay is `{ seed, tickRate, version, commands[] }` where each
command is `{ tick, playerId, command }`. Playback re-simulates from tick 0.

**Reason:** Command streams are orders of magnitude smaller than state
snapshots, and re-simulation is a continuous proof that determinism holds — a
desync in playback is a determinism bug worth knowing about.

**Consequence:** Every command in `sim/commands.ts` must stay **serializable** —
no functions, no Three.js objects, no DOM references in a command payload.
Replays must store the tick rate and a version so old replays can be rejected
rather than silently desyncing.

---

## D-009 — The AI opponent is developed incrementally alongside features
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** A basic CPU opponent is built now and levelled up with each new
system, rather than written from scratch late.

**Reason:** An AI written after the fact has to reverse-engineer every system at
once. An AI grown alongside the game stays cheap to extend, and it doubles as a
continuous integration test of the systems it drives — if the AI can't gather,
gathering is broken. It also means there is always something to play against.

**Consequence:** The AI issues the *same* commands a human does, through
`sim/commands.ts`. It gets no privileged access to state it should not see.
This keeps it honest and keeps it replayable.

---

## D-010 — Sim state is plain, reachable data (rollback prerequisite)
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** No sim state may live anywhere a structured clone cannot reach.
No closures, no functions, no `Map`/`Set` held on `World`, no references
between entities other than ids.

**Reason:** Rollback netcode, replays and server-side match validation are all
the same three operations — snapshot, restore, hash — and all three break on
unreachable state. This was not hypothetical: `World.rng` was a closure, so the
generator's position was unreachable. A fresh sim from tick 0 still worked, so
nothing failed visibly, but rollback could not have restored the RNG position
and every rewind would have desynced. Fixed by storing `rngState` as a number.

**Consequence:** `sim/snapshot.ts` owns `snapshot()`, `restore()` and `hash()`.
`restore()` mutates in place rather than returning a new object, because views
hold long-lived references to the `World`. `tests/determinism.test.ts` guards
all of it, including a JSON round trip — which a closure cannot survive.

**Cost if deferred:** this is cheap now and near-impossible later. Retrofitting
snapshot-safety means auditing every field added in between.

---

## D-011 — Rollback netcode: the state layout is the real decision
**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Amended 2026-07-27:** rollback **deferred** by the designer as too ambitious
for now. See D-016 for what that does and does not cost.

**Decision:** Target rollback netcode. Keep `structuredClone` for now; route
every snapshot through `sim/snapshot.ts` so the representation can change
without touching call sites.

**Reason, and the honest caveat.** Rollback is standard in fighting games — two
players, tiny state, snapshot 60×/sec trivially. An RTS is the opposite: 100+
entities means state is orders of magnitude larger, which is exactly why most
RTS ship **lockstep with input delay** instead. Rollback here is achievable but
it is a genuine engineering commitment, and the thing that decides whether it
is affordable is **state layout**, not netcode cleverness.

- Object graph + `structuredClone` (today): allocates, walks the graph, GC
  pressure. Fine at current scale, will not hold at 100+ units × 30 Hz.
- Structure-of-arrays over typed arrays: snapshot becomes `TypedArray.set()`
  into a ring buffer — a memcpy, microseconds, zero allocation.

**Not rewriting to SoA yet** — it would stall Phase 1 for a system that has no
consumer. But D-010's plain-data rule keeps the option open at zero cost, and
`snapshot.ts` is the single file that changes when the time comes.

**Interaction with D-004:** rollback multiplies sim cost by the rollback window.
A 7-tick rewind is 7× the work in one frame. This *strengthens* the case for
30 Hz over 128 — at 128 Hz the same wall-clock window is ~30 ticks to
re-simulate.

**Measure before committing:** snapshot+restore cost at 50 / 100 / 200 units.
If a snapshot exceeds roughly a third of a frame at target unit count, take
lockstep-with-input-delay instead and revisit. That is a real outcome, not a
failure.

---

## D-012 — Replays, matchmaking and MMR ride on determinism
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** Automated match replays and global matchmaking with MMR are
product requirements. All three of replay, rollback and rating validation are
served by the same foundation from D-010.

**Reason:** A deterministic sim makes each of these cheap rather than each
needing its own machinery:

| Requirement | What it needs |
|---|---|
| Automated replays | Command stream + seed + start hour (D-008) |
| Replay seeking | `restore()` to the nearest keyframe, then re-simulate |
| Rollback | `restore()` + N × `simStep()` |
| Desync detection | `hash()` compared per tick |
| MMR result validation | Server re-simulates and confirms the final `hash()` |
| Anti-cheat | A client cannot report a result the command stream does not produce |

**Consequence:** replays must record seed, tick rate, **start hour** and a
version. Any of these missing makes a replay silently wrong rather than
obviously broken. MMR is otherwise a backend concern and does not constrain the
sim beyond this.

---

## D-013 — Day/night cycle is simulation state, in ticks
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** Ten real minutes per full in-game day. The cycle is derived from
`world.tick` plus a `dayStartTick` offset, so a match may begin at any hour.
Time of day is displayed at all times in the HUD.

**Reason:** A day counter looks like pure decoration, and the obvious
implementation is `performance.now()` in the renderer. That is a trap. The
moment anything gameplay-facing reads the time of day — night vision ranges, a
night-only unit, a timed objective, or simply a player choosing to attack at
dusk — a wall-clock cycle desyncs across peers and cannot be replayed. Deriving
it from the tick costs nothing and closes the door before anyone walks through
it.

**Consequence:** `dayStartTick` is part of hashed state, so a replay cannot
restore a match to the wrong time of day and still report agreement. Day length
is declared in `data/tuning.ts` as **real seconds** and converted to ticks once,
so changing `TICK_HZ` cannot silently change day length.

**Presentation:** `render/skyCycle.ts` derives sun direction, light colour, sky
and fog from the sim clock and never writes back. Night lifts ambient well above
physical darkness deliberately — a strategy game that is hard to read at night
is one people refuse to play at night.

---

## D-014 — The war table: free-flight camera, not a traditional RTS view
**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Status:** direction locked, implementation deliberately deferred

**Decision:** Replace the top-down pan/zoom camera. The map is a holographic
war table floating in an otherwise empty universe. The player flies freely
around it and views it from any angle, scaling themselves from *miniature*
(down inside the map, among the units) to *enormous* (the whole table at a
glance).

**Reason:** It is the camera the rest of the design already implies. The player
is an Operations Commander reading an operational picture, not a soldier with a
fixed viewport — a war table is literally what commanders use. It also makes
`UI_BLUEPRINT.md`'s mission visualisation (arrows, fallback lines, logistics
routes) read as objects on a table rather than overlays on a screen.

**Rejected:** traditional pan/zoom/edge-scroll. Retained only as a fallback if
free flight proves to hurt readability in competitive play.

### Consequences — these are the parts that cost something

1. **It invalidates an assumption in the art pass (D-005).** That work justified
   omitting close-range detail because "at a far top-down RTS camera it buys
   little". If the player can shrink into the map, close-up detail is exactly
   what they will be looking at. The renderer will need real LOD: cheap
   impostors at table scale, genuine detail at miniature scale. **Do not read
   D-005's omissions as permanent — they were scoped to a camera that is now
   being replaced.**

2. **It changes the sky cycle (D-013).** Aerial-perspective fog fading toward a
   sky colour assumes a horizon. In an empty universe there is none. The day/
   night cycle must light *the table* while the surround stays void — closer to
   a lit diorama than a landscape. Fog becomes a table-edge falloff, not
   distance haze. `render/skyCycle.ts` will need revisiting; the sim-side clock
   in `sim/daynight.ts` is unaffected, which is the point of the split.

3. **The map needs a defined edge.** Terrain is currently an infinite-feeling
   plane. A floating table has a visible rim, underside and silhouette, and all
   three become art surfaces.

4. **Culling and LOD stop being optional.** A fixed top-down camera makes both
   easy. Arbitrary angles plus arbitrary scale make them load-bearing for the
   100-unit target (D-006).

5. **The minimap is reconsidered.** In `UI_BLUEPRINT.md` the minimap is a
   strategic intelligence display. With a war table already showing the whole
   map at a glance, the minimap may be redundant, or may become the *fast
   travel* control rather than an overview. Open question.

**Sequencing:** deferred by the designer's explicit instruction — capture now,
build in the right order. It should land **before** the remaining art work on
units, buildings and scenery, so that work is done once against the real camera
rather than twice. The sim is entirely unaffected either way, which is why
deferring it is safe.

---

## D-015 — Project codename is Longbarrow, distinct from the race names
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** The project is codenamed **Longbarrow**. Repository, package name
and page title use it. The four races keep their own names.

**Reason:** The project was previously titled "Cohort RTS", which conflates the
project with *Cohort*, one of four playable races and the Phase 1 proving
ground. That naming ages badly — by Phase 3 the game contains four races and
being named after one of them is misleading, and it quietly implies Cohort is
the protagonist faction when the design explicitly treats all four as forces of
nature with no privileged viewpoint.

A longbarrow is a prehistoric burial mound, grassed over. It carries the same
imagery Cohort's visual identity is built from — ancient machinery of death,
gently overgrown, as inherent to the landscape as a hill — without being the
race's name. Evocative of the world rather than of one faction in it.

**Consequence:** `Cohort` continues to mean the race, everywhere in the design
documents. Only project-level titles changed: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`package.json`, and the page `<title>`.


---

## D-016 — Rollback deferred; the foundation stays because it was never rollback-specific
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** Stop pursuing rollback netcode for now. Keep `sim/snapshot.ts`,
the plain-data rule (D-010) and the determinism tests exactly as they are.

**The question this answers:** does deferring rollback hurt development later?
**No** — and specifically:

**Nothing built for it is wasted.** Snapshot, restore and hash were never
rollback-only. Each has an independent consumer that is still wanted:

| Capability | Needs | Still wanted? |
|---|---|---|
| Replay seeking | `restore()` to a keyframe | Yes — D-012 |
| Desync detection | `hash()` per tick | Yes, for any netcode |
| Save / load a match | `snapshot()` + `restore()` | Yes |
| Server-side MMR validation | re-simulate, compare `hash()` | Yes — D-012 |
| Determinism regression tests | all three | Yes, already running |
| AI lookahead ("what if I attack here?") | `snapshot()` + simulate + `restore()` | Likely — D-009 |

Even if rollback is never built, none of this becomes dead code.

**Nothing was spent that would not have been spent anyway.** The costly parts
of rollback — per-tick snapshotting, a structure-of-arrays rewrite, prediction
and reconciliation — were deliberately *not* started. D-011 gated them behind a
measurement precisely so they would not be built on speculation.

**The option stays open at zero ongoing cost.** The only thing rollback needs
preserved is D-010's rule: sim state must be plain reachable data — no closures,
no functions, no `Map`/`Set` on `World`. That rule is worth keeping on its own
merits (replays and networking both require it), it is enforced by existing
tests, and it costs nothing to follow.

**What to do instead when multiplayer arrives:** deterministic lockstep with
input delay. It is what most RTS ship, it reuses the same command stream
`sim/replay.ts` already produces, and it needs no snapshotting at all. If
rollback is ever revisited, D-011's measurement gate is still the right first
step — do not start with netcode, start by measuring snapshot cost at 100+ units.

**The one thing that would genuinely hurt later:** letting unreachable state
back into `World`. A closure, a `Map`, or an object reference between entities
would break replays and validation too, not just rollback — and it would be
invisible until something desyncs. Keep the rule.

---

## D-017 — Map seed is separate from match seed
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** `World.mapSeed` is distinct from the match seed. The same map seed
always produces the same map, and map generation draws from its own generator —
never from `world.rngState`. Maps also carry a `MAP_VERSION`.

**Reason.** They look like one number and must not be. Three things break if
they are shared:

1. **A map browser becomes impossible.** Previewing a seed would advance the
   match generator, so the match you then played would differ from the match
   you would have played without previewing.
2. **You cannot replay a match on a map you liked.** With one seed there is no
   way to hold the map fixed and vary the match, or vice versa.
3. **Matches on different maps diverge for unrelated reasons.** Generating a
   larger map consumes more random draws, silently shifting every later combat
   roll.

**`MAP_VERSION` is the non-obvious half.** A seed alone does not reproduce a
map — the generator must match too. Without a version, improving map generation
would silently make every existing seed produce different terrain, and old
replays would play out on ground that no longer matches what was recorded.
Versioning converts that from a plausible wrong answer into an explicit
rejection, exactly as tick rate already does.

**Consequence:** `mapSeed` and `mapVersion` are in the hashed state and in the
replay format (`REPLAY_VERSION` → 2). `generateScenery()` takes its RNG source
as an argument rather than reaching for the world's.

**Still to build:** actual procedural generation. Terrain is currently a fixed
formula and the map layout is hand-placed, so seeds vary only scenery today.
The seed *plumbing* is done and correct, which is the part that would have been
expensive to retrofit; the generator can be written whenever.

---

## D-018 — Multiplayer path: deterministic lockstep with input delay
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** When multiplayer arrives, build **deterministic lockstep with
input delay**. Confirmed by the designer, superseding rollback (D-016).

**Reason:** It is what most RTS ship, for the reason RTS keep choosing it —
state is far too large to snapshot per frame at 100+ units. It also reuses what
already exists: `sim/replay.ts` produces exactly the serializable per-tick
command stream lockstep needs to exchange, and `hash()` gives per-tick desync
detection for free.

**Consequence:** input delay becomes a tuning number (typically 2–4 ticks; at
30 Hz that is 66–133 ms). This raises the value of the immediate
input-acknowledgement work already in `TODO.md` — under lockstep, local
feedback on the frame of the click is what hides the delay.

---

## D-019 — Combat damage is a deterministic expectation, not a die roll
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** Accuracy multiplies damage rather than gating a hit/miss roll.
Combat consumes no RNG at all.

**Reason:** §2 asks for battles that are "quick and decisive", where "initial
positioning determines the outcome more than mid-fight adjustments" and micro is
"not a major skill factor". A to-hit roll works against all three — it adds
variance that rewards neither positioning nor skill, only luck, and it makes
identical engagements resolve differently for no reason a player can act on.

Folding accuracy in as a multiplier keeps every modifier in the game positional:
settle state, cohesion, elevation and facing all multiply together, and none of
them can be improved by clicking faster.

**Secondary benefit:** combat touching no RNG keeps the generator's position
independent of how many fights happened, which makes replays and future lockstep
markedly easier to reason about. Verified by test.

**Rejected:** per-attack hit rolls. Revisit only if playtesting shows fights
feel too deterministic — and if so, prefer variance in *damage magnitude* over
hit/miss, which preserves expected outcomes.

---

## D-020 — Cohesion is measured by proximity, not squad membership
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** The diminishing-returns penalty counts friendly combat units
within `COHESION.radius`, not members of a squad. Workers are exempt.

**Reason:** The design text is ambiguous — §8.6 names the mechanic "Squad
Cohesion", while §2 describes it as "20+ units in one place". Squad-based
counting is the more literal reading and the wrong one: it is trivially
dodgeable, because an *ungrouped* blob would take no penalty at all, and that
blob is precisely the formation the rule exists to discourage.

Proximity-based counting cannot be gamed, is readable on the battlefield (you
can see the crowd), and matches the §2 wording. Workers are exempt because a
mining camp is a dense cluster that has nothing to do with deathballing.

**Numbers solved backwards from §2's requirement** that "a 30–40 unit army
should only barely beat a 20–25 unit army": at cap 20 and 0.025 per excess unit,
a 35-stack fields ~21.9 effective units against a 22-stack's ~20.9 — a ~5% edge.
A test asserts this ratio directly, so retuning the constants cannot silently
break the design intent.

**Open:** Cohort's stated flavour is Command Overload — past the cap a squad
needs a second officer-type unit (the Chronicler) to keep full accuracy. That
unit is Phase 1 roster but unimplemented, so the penalty currently always
applies; the Chronicler becomes a mitigation hook when it lands.

---

## D-021 — Resource vocabulary direction: Material / Legacy / Dominion / Relics
**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Status:** direction accepted; implementation naming deferred

**Direction:** The resource set should tell the game's history rather than read
as minerals plus energy:

- **Material** — the physical world; used to build.
- **Legacy** — understanding inherited from previous civilizations; used to learn.
- **Dominion** — control exercised in the present.
- **Relics** — rare opportunities that change future options.

**Reason:** `Essence` no longer accurately describes the gatherable resource if
its role is understanding rather than energy. The proposed quartet communicates
build / learn / rule / adapt and fits the "Miniature Myth" identity.

**Consequence:** Do not globally rename `essence` yet. First resolve which of the
four concepts are currencies, territory statistics, map objectives, or upgrade
choices. A premature search-and-replace would collapse distinct systems into one.
Track the final schema in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` before migration.

---

## D-022 — Mycora fantasy: aggressive life as a tidal infection
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** Mycora is a distributed hivemind that advances and recedes like
water. Units are temporary shapes inside the larger organism, not fully
individual creatures. Death leaves living stains—moss, fungus, flowers, and
iridescent growth—that can grant vision, expand domain, and later support other
mechanics.

**Art constraint:** It is a burst of thriving rainbow life with inspiration from
*Annihilation*, but it must never read as benevolent nature or as a visual copy
of the Zerg. The inversion is deliberate: abundant life behaves like cancer.

**Gameplay consequence:** Corpse stains/domain residue must eventually be sim
state, deterministic, replayable, and readable by AI. It is not merely a decal.

---

## D-023 — Cohort Marksman weapon language
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** The Marksman carries its staff vertically and upright in one hand.
Its attack is genuinely emitted light, not a projectile merely styled like a
laser. Animation, effects, sound, and damage timing should preserve that read.

---

## D-024 — Conclave material language
**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Status:** art direction seed

**Decision:** Conclave forms should appear almost constructed from water and
fabric. This is a silhouette/material constraint for later concept development,
not yet a finalized production specification.

---

## D-025 — The gatherable resource is violet, never teal
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** `PALETTE.legacy` (formerly `essence`) is violet — shade `#3b2a55`,
mid `#b98ad9`, lit `#f0dcff`. Teal and cyan-blue are retired from the resource
entirely.

**Reason.** Teal failed on two counts, and the second is the more serious:

1. **It reads as StarCraft minerals.** Glowing blue crystal shards are the most
   recognisable resource in the genre. §8.8 spends its length ruling out
   accidental StarCraft parallels for the races; leaving the resource looking
   like minerals undoes that at the most-looked-at object on the map.
2. **Teal is Conclave's colour.** Conclave is Water (D-021 framing, §8.8). A
   universal resource wearing one race's element quietly steals that race's
   visual identity before it is even implemented — and Conclave arrives in
   Phase 3, so the collision would have been discovered late and expensively.

Violet is claimed by none of the four elements (Cohort bone-and-gold, Mycora
green, Conclave blue, Titanfolk stone), sits opposite the warm sun so it stays
legible against sunlit grass, and reads as "precious and old" rather than "ore" —
which matches what the resource actually *is* under D-021: **Legacy**,
understanding inherited from a dead civilization, not a mineral.

**Consequence:** `essenceMat` is aliased to `legacyMat` rather than renamed
outright, because D-021 explicitly defers the global `essence` rename until the
four-resource schema is settled. The colour changes now; the vocabulary waits.

---

## D-026 — Far-zoom world silhouette: the World Turtle
**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Status:** locked presentation direction

**Decision:** At normal gameplay distance the battlefield remains a readable
physical war table in a black void. As the camera pulls far enough away for the
whole board to become small, the support form must resolve into a monumental,
stylized world-bearing turtle: the land rests on its shell/back and the complete
silhouette becomes legible only at strategic/cosmic scale.

**Progressive reveal:**
- Close and normal play: terrain surface and temporary descending skirts dominate;
  the carrier is hidden or only subtly implied.
- Mid zoom: shell curvature and the sculptural underside begin to read.
- Maximum zoom: head, limbs, tail, and shell produce a clear mythic silhouette in
  the black void while the battlefield remains visible on top.

**Constraint:** This is not a cartoon turtle and not decorative scenery pasted
under the map. It should feel like an ancient cosmological model, sacred gaming
relic, and living world-support structure. Geometry, LOD, lighting, camera
clipping, and far-distance composition must be designed together.

**Future extension:** The current descending terrain body remains a temporary
placeholder. A later exploration may extend the cosmology into a restrained
"turtles all the way down" recursive reveal, but that is not required for the
first production World Turtle.

## D-027 — Mission lands as a sim entity, inert on its own
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** `Mission` (D-007) is now real sim state — `src/sim/missions.ts`,
hashed, replayed, tested. It does **not** yet drive squad behaviour.

**Reason:** the UI blueprint's mission panel needs a real primitive to build
against, not an ad-hoc UI state it invents itself and later has to retrofit
into the sim. Landing the data model first (objective, priority, assigned
squads, fallback, status) means that UI work is additive rather than a rewrite.

Deliberately inert: a mission does not currently change what an assigned squad
does. Deciding "assault mission -> squad behaviour X" is a real design
question (does it override the squad's own chain? layer on top of it? require
one?) that belongs with the mission-panel UI, not bundled into the primitive.

**Consequence:** `World.missions`, `REPLAY_VERSION` -> 5. A squad serves at
most one mission at a time — assigning it to a second silently drops the first,
mirroring how forming a new squad supersedes a unit's old one. Missions are
pruned of dead squad ids every tick by `stepMissions`, run after the reaper, so
a mission can never hold a dangling id that diverges between replay peers.

**Also verified this session:** the external "v1.23.0" import (fog of war,
minimap, LOD, tutorial, direct orders, map boundary, World Turtle far-zoom
silhouette — D-026) was fast-forward merged and independently re-verified:
typecheck, lint, 302 tests, `architecture.test.ts` (sim purity), and a manual
grep for `Math.random`/`Date.now`/`performance.now` in `sim/`. All clean.

## D-028 — Research: category-wide, derived-not-baked, engine-agnostic
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** Cohort's tech track ships as `src/data/tech.ts` (content) plus
`src/sim/tech.ts` (engine). Seven upgrades across three tiers, including one
doctrine pair.

**Three choices worth recording, because the obvious alternative is wrong in
each case:**

**1. Effects are category-wide, never per-unit.** §8.5 asks for upgrades that
apply "broadly to a category of unit/behavior, not a single unit". A per-unit
upgrade list turns the roster into independent tuning knobs; a category list is
a doctrine. Categories are derived from unit stats (`isWorker`, weapon range),
not from a hardcoded name list, so a new unit joins the right upgrades by
declaring its stats.

**2. Modifiers are derived on demand, never baked into units on completion.**
Baking is faster and is what most engines do. It is also silently wrong under
`restore()`: rewinding to a tick before a tech completed would leave units
carrying stats they should not have, and nothing would catch it, because the
baked stats are not themselves the hashed source of truth. Deriving keeps the
researched list as the only truth — which is what `hash()` covers. A test
asserts that clearing the researched list restores original stats.

**3. Doctrine pairs do not lock each other out.** Taking Attrition first leaves
Vanguard fully available. That is the specific property distinguishing Cohort
(§8.5 "nothing permanently locked out", mastery is *timing*) from Conclave
(genuine foreclosure). Easy to get wrong by copying the usual RTS branch model;
a test guards it.

**Consequence:** `World.tech` per team, hashed with the researched list sorted
so two equivalent research orders agree. `REPLAY_VERSION` → 6.

## D-029 — Engine-first: race content declares traits, the engine reads them
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** `src/sim/` must not name any specific unit, building or
technology. Race-specific mechanics are declared as **traits in `src/data/`**
and read generically by the engine.

**Reason:** the stated project philosophy is that scrapping all four races and
rebuilding should be cheap. That only holds if the simulation is a rules engine
and races are content. It had already drifted: `combat.ts` implemented the
shield wall as `if (unit.type !== 'legionnaire') return 0` — a Cohort mechanic
living inside the engine, which a from-scratch race would have had to edit
`sim/` to reuse.

Now `UnitDef.formsShieldWall` is a declared trait and the engine counts
same-type wall-forming neighbours generically. A future race gets the mechanic
by setting a boolean.

**Known remaining leak:** `sim/ai.ts` still names `'legionnaire'`/`'marksman'`
when choosing what to build. Left deliberately — fixing it properly needs a
race-roster abstraction ("give me this race's basic melee unit"), which is
worth doing when the second race lands and there is a real second case to
generalise against, rather than guessing the shape now. Tracked in TODO.

**Test:** `tests/tech.test.ts` asserts the tech engine drives entirely off the
data table and has no dangling prerequisites.

## D-030 — Project codename becomes Greenmantle (supersedes D-015)
**Date:** 2026-07-27

**Decision:** The project is renamed from **Longbarrow** to **Greenmantle**.

**Reason:** Longbarrow named a burial mound — bones, a dead thing grassed over.
That was right when the project was a fossil race and a terrain slab. It is no
longer what the project is. The build now carries four races framed as living
elemental forces, an overgrowth-first art direction where weathering is a real
material across *all* races, a day/night world, and a world-bearing turtle at
cosmological zoom. The old name described only the dead half.

*Greenmantle* keeps the same duality — a mantle is both a cloak and a layer of
the earth — but leads with the living side: the green that has grown over the
ancient machine, rather than the barrow underneath it. It carries forward
rather than replacing, which is the right relationship to a codename that was
never wrong, only outgrown.

**Unchanged deliberately:**

- **The GitHub repository is still `Wizard1999/Greenmantle`.** The codename
  moved first; renaming the repo is a separate manual step. `START_HERE.md`
  says so explicitly, because an agent that "corrects" the remote to match the
  codename would point it at nothing.
- **The save-file magic string stays `longbarrow-save`.** It is a format
  identifier, not a display name. Renaming it would make every save written
  before today fail to load, in exchange for nothing. Format identifiers follow
  the format's history, not the project's branding.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` and earlier decisions keep the old name.** They are dated
  records of what was true then; rewriting history to match present branding
  would make them lies.

**Consequence:** `package.json`, all live docs, page titles, the launcher
scripts (`PLAY_GREENMANTLE.bat`, `OPEN_GREENMANTLE_WEBSITE.bat`) and versioned
handoff naming (`Greenmantle-v1.23.0-work`) now use Greenmantle. D-015 is
superseded but retained — the reasoning that produced Longbarrow is still the
reasoning that produced its successor.

## D-031 — Two gathered resources: common Material, rare Legacy
**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Status:** locked (designer) · **Resolves:** D-021 deferral, `GAME_DESIGN.md § 11.1`, `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` A1/A6

D-021 accepted **Material / Legacy / Dominion / Relics** as a vocabulary
direction but deferred which of the four are spendable. Settled by the designer:

| Concept | Status |
|---|---|
| **Material** | Gathered currency. **Common**, plentiful, the everyday input — builds and trains. |
| **Legacy** | Gathered currency. **Rare**, contested, few nodes — buys research and advanced units. Violet (D-025). |
| **Dominion** | Deferred. Domain/territory mechanics arrive as their own system later, not as a currency now. |
| **Relics** | Deferred until PvP is settled. Rare opportunities are a competitive-integrity question before they are a content question. |

**Reason for two, one rare:** the scarce resource is what puts a *reason* on
specific ground. With a single currency, all nodes are interchangeable and map
control is an abstraction; with a rare second one, the few Legacy nodes are
objectives whose value comes from position — which is the "terrain decides
fights" pillar expressed economically rather than only tactically. It also gives
the tech system (D-028) a real cost curve: research competes against army for a
resource you cannot simply gather more of by adding workers.

**The tension this creates, and how it is held:** two resources normally
reintroduce worker micro, which "set-and-forget economy" exists to delete. The
resolution is that **the split must never require per-worker allocation.**
Workers take a default assignment and rebalance themselves; a player who ignores
the economy entirely still gathers both. The decision the player makes is *which
nodes to hold*, on the map, not *which worker mines what*, in a panel. If
implementation starts drifting toward a mineral/gas allocation minigame, the
implementation is wrong, not this decision.

**Engine-first: two is content, not architecture (D-029, `ENGINE_VISION.md`).**
The engine must not learn the number two. Implement a **resource registry in
`src/data/`** — an ordered list of resource definitions (id, display name,
colour, rarity, node behaviour) — and hold stocks as a **bag keyed by resource
id** rather than named fields on `World`. `material` and `legacy` are then two
rows of data a game author can delete, rename, or extend to five without
touching `src/sim/`. Costs become `{ [resourceId]: amount }`, the HUD renders one
row per declared resource, and the AI reasons over "the resource this thing
needs" rather than a field name.

Two determinism constraints on that shape, both non-negotiable: iterate resources
via the **declared order from `src/data/`**, never `Object.keys()` on the bag
(insertion order must never reach results — see `CLAUDE.md`); and the bag stays a
plain object, not a `Map`, so `structuredClone` still carries it (D-010).

**Consequence:** the `essence` → registry migration is a real change (sim state
shape, every cost in `src/data/`, HUD, AI reasoning, `SAVE_VERSION` bump, state
hash) and must land **atomically** — a half-migrated economy passes tests while
being incoherent. Queued in `TODO.md` as its own change, not bundled into other
work. `PALETTE.legacy` and `legacyMat` already name the rare one correctly;
Material needs a colour that avoids violet (Legacy), teal (Conclave, D-025) and
green (Mycora) — warm ochre is the leading candidate, with the caveat that it
must stay distinct from Titanfolk's stone.

**Rejected:** one universal currency, on the grounds above — it was the prior
recommendation, and it made every resource node identical and therefore made
holding ground economically meaningless.

## D-032 — Stealth is terrain concealment, not cloaking
**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Status:** locked (designer) · **Resolves:** `GAME_DESIGN.md § 11.1`

Two units already assume a stealth system that was defined nowhere: Cohort's
Chronicler ("reveals stealth") and Conclave's Phantom ("illusions/stealth").

**The rule:** there are **no permanently invisible units**. Concealment is a
property of *ground*, not of units. A unit standing in cover (forest, deep
shadow, and whatever later terrain declares itself concealing) is hidden from
enemies outside a short detection radius. **Moving fast or attacking reveals
you.** Detection is a radius every unit has and some units have more of — the
Chronicler *widens* detection rather than granting a binary reveal.

**Reason:** classic cloak-plus-detector was rejected because it is a hard
counter. Without the detector unit you do not play badly, you simply lose, and
the correct response is a build-order lookup rather than a decision on the
board — the precise failure mode this design exists to avoid. Terrain
concealment instead feeds the **"terrain decides fights"** pillar: cover becomes
another reason position beats stats, it is legible from the map itself, and it
needs no counter-unit to exist for the mechanic to be fair.

**Engine-first: this is Greenmantle's answer, not the engine's only one (D-029,
`ENGINE_VISION.md`).** Terrain concealment is the rule *this game* declares; the
engine must make a StarCraft-style cloak reachable as **content, not a fork**.
So the engine models concealment generically as *sources of concealment* and
*sources of detection*, each declared as traits in `src/data/`:

- a **terrain** trait can conceal whoever stands on it (Greenmantle uses this),
- a **unit** trait can conceal its bearer unconditionally (a cloak — declared by a
  game that wants one, and the engine does not care that Greenmantle doesn't),
- a **detection radius** on any unit or building reveals concealed things inside
  it, and a game may set the default radius to zero to get hard-counter cloaking
  or non-zero to get Greenmantle's softer version.

Resolving "is X visible to team Y" therefore reads declared traits and never asks
what kind of game this is. Picking terrain-only is one line of content.

**Consequence:** concealment is a **trait read generically by the engine**
(D-029), never a unit-name check and never an `if (game === 'greenmantle')`. The
Chronicler is buildable without waiting on a cloak system — it simply declares a
larger detection radius. Conclave's Phantom becomes illusion-and-cover rather
than invisibility, a Phase 3 problem with its rules already fixed. A third-party
game shipping full cloak-and-detector play must require **zero** `src/sim/`
changes; if it would, this decision was implemented wrongly.

## D-033 — Map geometry is generation, not a new system; tunnels and ramps emerge
**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Status:** locked (designer) · **Resolves:** `GAME_DESIGN.md § 11.1`

An early rejected *theme* ("living playset warfare") carried a mechanical idea
worth keeping: tunnels, ramps and hidden routes as first-class map elements.
**Assessed as already covered — this is missing map content, not a missing
system.** A ramp is a heightfield gradient; a chokepoint is the polygon boundary
narrowing; a hidden route is fog plus a path nobody watches. All three are
already expressible with what exists.

**Therefore the work is generation, not mechanics.** Ramps, tunnels and
alternate routes must **arise innately from the generator** rather than being
authored as special entities with their own rules. A generator that produces
smooth noise gives high ground with no distinct approach, which makes positional
combat unreadable — so producing legible ramps, chokepoints and flankable routes
is a *correctness condition* on map generation, and belongs with the procedural
map work already queued. What is wanted from here is **complication**: geometry
that creates approaches, cover and surprise, generated rather than hand-placed.

**Reason for not building a tunnel entity:** a paired off-surface link needs
pathing, fog and render support plus its own determinism tests, in exchange for
something the terrain can already express if the generator is good enough. Solve
it in generation first; only add an explicit mechanic if generation genuinely
cannot produce the play.

**See D-035** for the feel these maps are generated *toward* — the arcade
principle governs what "good geometry" means here.

## D-034 — Air draws from the same supply pool as ground
**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Status:** locked (designer) · **Resolves:** `GAME_DESIGN.md § 11.1`

§7 names "command bandwidth" as a mechanism discouraging the air deathball but
never tied it to the §8.3 supply table (Command / Population / Coordination /
Territory). **Every unit draws from the same per-race pool — air included. There
is one supply pool, never a per-domain pool.**

**Reason:** this is the whole anti-deathball mechanism, and a separate air pool
would delete it. If air has its own cap, air is *additive* — massing it costs
you nothing you were otherwise using, which is how deathballs form and would
then require a bespoke second anti-mass mechanic to undo. Shared supply makes
every air unit a ground unit you did not field, so going all-in on air costs you
the map. §8.3 stays the single lever, with nothing new to tune.

**Consequence:** unblocks Phase 4.2 in advance. The supply system needs no
structural change to accept air later — air costs are ordinary supply costs in
`src/data/`. Recorded now because supply design decisions made before this was
settled could have quietly assumed a separate pool.

## D-035 — Arcade legibility over simulation realism
**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Status:** locked (designer) · **Scope:** maps, movement, terrain, level geometry

Design target for space and movement: **fun and exploratory, not realistic.**
The reference frame is *Halo* and *Quake* rather than *Battlefield* — arcade
geometry, readable at a glance, rewarding curiosity.

**What this means concretely:**

- **Geometry is authored for play, not plausibility.** A ramp exists because it
  makes an approach interesting, not because erosion would have put it there.
  Terrain that would be realistic but unreadable is wrong.
- **Exploration is a reward.** Maps should contain routes and positions worth
  discovering — the flank nobody took, the ledge that overlooks a node. This is
  what "complication" in D-033 is aiming at.
- **Legibility beats fidelity.** If a player cannot tell high ground from low, or
  see that a gap is passable, the terrain has failed regardless of how good it
  looks. Painterly art (D-005) serves this: the hue path reads shape.
- **Movement should feel good before it feels grounded.** Responsiveness and
  clean silhouettes over weight and simulated friction.

**Reason it is logged:** this is the kind of principle that is obvious to the
designer and invisible in the repository, so it gets re-litigated every time a
generator or camera decision comes up. It also resolves a real ambiguity —
"terrain decides fights" could be read as arguing for realistic, simulationist
terrain, and it does not. Terrain matters *because it is legible and
exploitable*, which is an arcade property.

**Engine-first:** arcade is *Greenmantle's* dial setting, not a property welded
into the generator. Generation exposes its character as **declared presets and
parameters in `src/data/`** — ramp frequency, chokepoint tightness, route
redundancy, verticality — so a game author who wants sprawling realistic terrain
changes numbers rather than code. Greenmantle ships an arcade preset; the
generator itself must have no opinion.

**Consequence:** governs procedural map generation (D-033), the remaining camera
work (D-014) and future movement tuning. When realism and readability conflict
*in Greenmantle*, readability wins without further discussion.
